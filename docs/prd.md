## Executive Summary

MOAR ATS is the in-house, AI-native applicant tracking system crafted for India-first GCC tenants. It delivers an opinionated recruiting backbone—tenant-aware workflow engine, branded recruiter/candidate touchpoints, and an explainable AI co-pilot—so MOAR Advisory can dogfood the platform before rolling it out to other GCCs. Every capability reinforces trust: resume parsing and scoring come with rationales, compliance evidence is generated automatically, and GitOps-ready infrastructure keeps deployments repeatable across Podman/OpenShift or hyperscalers.

### What Makes This Special

- Agentic recruiting workflows that learn recruiter and candidate behavior, then adapt outreach, rankings, and task orchestration without going rogue.
- Compliance-by-default posture for DPDP/GDPR with audit-grade logs, consent tracking, and evidence packs tailored to GCC review cycles.
- India-first delivery stack: multi-tenant core, Terraform + ArgoCD pipelines, and Podman-friendly packaging so enterprises can host anywhere with confidence.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** saas_b2b  
**Domain:** general (enterprise talent)  
**Complexity:** low (Phase 1, compliance roadmap queued for Phase 2)

MOAR ATS matches the SaaS B2B pattern from the classification dataset: signals like “platform,” “multi-tenant,” “enterprise teams,” and “compliance guardrails” align with the saas_b2b row, so we inherit expectations around tenant models, RBAC, integration catalogs, and subscription tiers. Domain-wise this is an enterprise talent platform with elevated governance needs; the general domain template fits today’s “general but careful” requirement while leaving hooks to escalate into high-compliance modes in Phase 2.

## Domain-Specific Requirements

### Enterprise Talent Platform Considerations

While MOAR ATS operates in the general enterprise talent domain (low complexity for Phase 1), several standard concerns apply:

**Standard Requirements:**
- Multi-tenant data isolation with row-level security and namespace separation
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for recruiters, hiring managers, TA leaders, and compliance partners
- Audit trails for all candidate interactions, decisions, and data access
- Integration readiness for HRIS systems, email/calendar, and background check providers

**Basic Security:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit for candidate PII
- Secure authentication (SSO-ready) and session management
- API rate limiting and tenant-aware request validation
- Immutable audit logs that cannot be tampered with post-creation

**User Experience:**
- Responsive web interfaces for recruiter and candidate portals
- Mobile-friendly views for on-the-go recruiter workflows
- Clear, explainable AI outputs that build trust rather than confusion
- Accessibility baseline (WCAG 2.1 AA) for inclusive candidate experiences

**Performance:**
- Sub-second response times for core workflows (job posting, candidate search, resume parsing)
- Scalable architecture to handle multiple GCC tenants without degradation
- Efficient bulk operations (batch imports, exports, compliance evidence generation)

These requirements shape the functional and non-functional requirements detailed below. Phase 2 will escalate into high-complexity compliance modes (SOC-2, labor law automation, region-specific evidence packs) as documented in the growth features section.

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### AI Agentic Workflows That Learn and Adapt

MOAR ATS introduces a novel pattern: **recruiting workflows that become more autonomous as they learn recruiter and candidate behavior**. This isn't just "AI-assisted" — it's an adaptive system that:

- Observes recruiter patterns (how they score resumes, what outreach messages get responses, which interview formats work best)
- Learns candidate preferences (communication style, scheduling flexibility, response patterns)
- Adapts its suggestions and automations without going rogue (human-in-the-loop guardrails)
- Gets better over time at predicting what recruiters need before they ask

**What Makes This Novel:**
- Most ATS tools are static: they do the same thing every time. MOAR ATS evolves.
- The AI doesn't just parse resumes — it learns which scoring criteria matter most to each recruiter/role combination.
- Outreach suggestions improve based on actual response rates, not generic templates.
- The system can orchestrate multi-step workflows (draft JD → post → parse resumes → rank → suggest outreach) while staying explainable.

**Key Innovation Signals (from saas_b2b classification):**
- Workflow automation that adapts (not just configurable)
- AI agents that learn from user behavior (not just rule-based)
- Explainable autonomy (transparency even as the system gets smarter)

### Validation Approach

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Start with human-in-the-loop mode: AI suggests, human approves every action
- Log all AI decisions with explanations (resume scores, ranking rationales, outreach drafts)
- Track adoption metrics: % of recruiters using AI suggestions, response rates to AI-drafted outreach
- Weekly retros with MOAR Advisory TA team to validate the "learning" is actually helpful

**Phase 2 (Growth):**
- Introduce supervised autonomy: AI can execute low-risk actions (scheduling, status updates) after learning patterns
- A/B test autonomous vs. assisted workflows to measure time savings and quality
- Build bias detection pipelines that flag when AI adaptations might introduce unfairness
- Create "AI explainability reports" that TA leaders can share with compliance teams

**Fallback Strategy:**
- If AI adaptations degrade quality or trust, roll back to static rule-based workflows
- Maintain audit logs of all AI learning events so we can diagnose what went wrong
- Keep human override controls at every decision point, even in autonomous mode

## saas_b2b Specific Requirements

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture

**Tenant Model:**
- **Isolation Strategy:** Row-level security with tenant_id on all data tables, plus namespace separation for storage buckets (resumes, offer letters, audit logs)
- **Tenant Identity:** Each GCC gets a unique tenant_id (e.g., "moar-advisory", "tenant-xyz")
- **Branding:** Each tenant can customize recruiter/candidate portal themes, logos, and email templates
- **Data Segregation:** Complete isolation — tenants cannot see each other's candidates, jobs, or workflows
- **Infrastructure:** Multi-tenant aware observability (tenant-tagged logs, metrics, traces) for compliance reviews

**Phase 1:** Single tenant (MOAR Advisory) with multi-tenant architecture foundations  
**Phase 2:** Multi-tenant SaaS with self-serve onboarding and tenant management UI

### Permissions & Roles

## User Experience Principles

### Visual Personality & Trust

MOAR ATS should feel **professional yet approachable** — the kind of tool that makes recruiters and candidates feel confident, not overwhelmed. Think "enterprise-grade but human-friendly."

**Design Vibe:**
- Clean, modern interface with plenty of white space (no cluttered dashboards)
- MOAR Advisory branding (colors, logos, typography) for recruiter portal
- Candidate portal should feel welcoming and transparent (not like a black box)
- AI explanations should be visual and easy to scan (not walls of text)

**Trust Signals:**
- Every AI decision (resume score, ranking) shows a clear explanation panel
- Compliance status indicators (consent captured, audit logs active)
- Transparent candidate journey timeline (they can see where they are in the process)
- Error messages that help, not confuse

### Key Interactions

**Recruiter Portal:**
- **Pipeline View:** Kanban-style board (Applied → Screening → Interview → Offer) with drag-and-drop candidate movement
- **AI Co-pilot Panel:** Sidebar that shows resume scores, ranking rationales, and suggested outreach — all with "why" explanations
- **Candidate Profile:** Rich view with resume, interview notes, AI insights, and activity timeline
- **Quick Actions:** One-click scheduling, outreach templates, status updates
- **Compliance Dashboard:** At-a-glance view of consent status, audit log completeness, export readiness

**Candidate Portal:**
- **Application Status:** Clear timeline showing current stage and what's next
- **Interview Scheduling:** Calendar picker with recruiter availability (no back-and-forth emails)
- **Communication Hub:** All messages, interview invites, and updates in one place
- **Data Access:** Easy export of their own data (DPDP/GDPR right to access)

**Critical User Flows:**
1. **Post Job → Receive Applications → AI Ranks → Recruiter Reviews → Schedule → Offer**
   - Should feel seamless, not like jumping between tools
2. **Candidate Applies → Gets Confirmation → Scheduling → Interview → Decision**
   - Candidate should always know where they stand
3. **Compliance Export → Generate Evidence Pack → Download**
   - One-click, not a 47-step wizard

**Mobile Considerations:**
- Responsive web (mobile-friendly views) for on-the-go recruiters
- Candidate portal optimized for mobile (many candidates apply from phones)
- Core workflows work on mobile, but power features (bulk operations, analytics) are desktop-first

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

**User-Facing Performance:**
- Core workflows (job posting, candidate search, resume parsing) respond in <2 seconds for 95th percentile
- Resume parsing completes in <5 seconds for standard PDF/DOCX files (up to 10MB)
- AI scoring and ranking calculations complete in <3 seconds for typical job postings (50-200 candidates)
- Candidate portal pages load in <1 second (first contentful paint)
- Recruiter dashboard (pipeline view, candidate list) loads in <2 seconds

**System Performance:**
- API endpoints respond in <500ms for read operations, <1 second for write operations (95th percentile)
- Bulk operations (bulk status updates, exports) complete within reasonable timeframes (progress indicators for long-running tasks)
- Database queries optimized for multi-tenant isolation (tenant_id indexes, query performance monitoring)

**Why It Matters:**
Recruiters work in fast-paced environments — slow systems kill productivity. Candidates expect modern web app responsiveness. AI calculations need to feel instant, not like "please wait while we think."

### Security

**Data Protection:**
- All candidate PII (personally identifiable information) encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption (AES-256)
- All data in transit encrypted using TLS 1.3
- Secure key management (secrets stored in secure vault, rotated regularly)
- Database backups encrypted with separate keys

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Secure password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, password history)
- Session management with configurable timeout (default 8 hours inactivity)
- SSO (single sign-on) support for enterprise tenants (SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support for sensitive roles (system admins, compliance partners)
- API authentication using bearer tokens or API keys with tenant-scoped permissions

**Access Controls:**
- Row-level security enforced at database level (tenant_id-based isolation)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at application level (every API call checks permissions)
- Audit logs capture all permission checks and access attempts
- Principle of least privilege (users only get permissions they need for their role)

**Why It Matters:**
Candidate data is sensitive (PII, resumes, interview notes). GCCs need enterprise-grade security to trust the platform. Compliance requirements (DPDP/GDPR) mandate strong security controls.

### Scalability

**Multi-Tenant Scalability:**
- Architecture supports 10+ tenants in Phase 1, 100+ tenants in Phase 2 without performance degradation
- Tenant data isolation scales horizontally (no single-tenant bottlenecks)
- Storage and compute resources scale independently per tenant (tenant-aware resource allocation)

**User Scalability:**
- System supports 100+ concurrent users per tenant (recruiters, hiring managers, candidates)
- Candidate application volume: handle 1000+ applications per job posting without slowdowns
- Bulk operations (imports, exports) scale to handle large datasets (10,000+ candidates per tenant)

**Infrastructure Scalability:**
- Stateless application services (can scale horizontally with load balancers)
- Database designed for horizontal scaling (read replicas, sharding strategies for Phase 2)
- Storage scales independently (object storage for resumes, audit logs, evidence packs)
- Observability stack scales with tenant growth (metrics, logs, traces don't overwhelm monitoring)

**Why It Matters:**
GCCs can have large hiring volumes. System must handle growth from MOAR Advisory (pilot) to multiple external GCCs (Phase 2) without architectural rewrites.

### Accessibility

**Web Accessibility:**
- Candidate and recruiter portals meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Keyboard navigation support (all features accessible without mouse)
- Screen reader compatibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, alt text for images)
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards (text readable, not just pretty)
- Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, desktop (candidates often apply from phones)

**Why It Matters:**
Inclusive candidate experience — candidates with disabilities should have equal access. Enterprise customers often require accessibility compliance (Section 508, WCAG) for procurement.

### Integration

**Integration Reliability:**
- All external integrations (email, calendar, HRIS, storage) have retry logic with exponential backoff
- Integration failures are logged, monitored, and alert operators (no silent failures)
- Webhook endpoints are idempotent (duplicate webhooks don't cause data corruption)
- Integration health checks and status monitoring (dashboards show integration status per tenant)

**Integration Performance:**
- Email/calendar integrations respond within SLA (e.g., calendar availability checks in <2 seconds)
- Webhook processing is asynchronous (doesn't block main workflows)
- Bulk data imports/exports support resumable operations (if interrupted, can resume from checkpoint)

**Integration Security:**
- API keys and credentials stored securely (encrypted, rotated regularly)
- Webhook endpoints validate signatures/authentication (prevent unauthorized calls)
- Integration logs are tenant-tagged and auditable

**Why It Matters:**
Recruiters rely on integrations for daily workflows (scheduling, email, HRIS sync). Broken integrations break trust. Enterprise customers need reliable, monitored integrations.
