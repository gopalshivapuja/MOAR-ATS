# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-11-25  
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary  
**Participant:** Gopal

## Session Start

Explored core features and capabilities for MOAR ATS with emphasis on AI-assisted applicant journeys, recruiter automation, transparent decisioning, and a Phase 2 vision for an Agent Application Tracking System (AATS).

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Core features and capabilities for MOAR ATS  
**Session Goals:** Define foundational ATS workflows, layer AI assistance responsibly, ensure transparency/auditability, plan multi-tenant scaling, and sketch Phase 2 innovations (Agent ATS, predictive hiring strategy).  
**Techniques Used:** First Principles Thinking, Mind Mapping, SCAMPER Method, What If Scenarios  
**Total Ideas Generated:** 26

### Key Themes Identified:

- AI as a trustworthy guide (justifications, overrides, audit trails)  
- Multi-channel, multi-tenant experience with recruiter co-pilots  
- India-first infrastructure (DigiLocker, Sunbird) plus global extensibility  
- Data as a strategic asset (talent fingerprints, compensation intelligence)  
- Phase 2 leap: hiring and managing AI agents alongside humans

## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking
- Defined atomic value units: successful hires, time saved, delightful experience, long-term talent graph, candidate fingerprints.
- Established requirements for AI transparency, auditability, and human overrides.
- Identified fundamental interactions between applicants, recruiters, hiring managers, and AI agents.
- Clarified real-time learning expectations and trust obligations.

### Mind Mapping
- Central hub: “MOAR ATS Core Features” branching into AI-assisted applicant experience, recruiter co-pilots, multi-channel comms, credential validation, extensible data architecture, transparency & trust, multi-tenant job boards, value creation engine.
- Added connections for industry intelligence, job mobility, monetization, and agentic workflows.
- Highlighted India-first integrations (DigiLocker, Sunbird) and Glassdoor-like analytics.

### SCAMPER Method
- Substitute: living profiles (optional) while keeping static resumes default; AI-first screening.
- Combine: single flow for application, validation, scheduling, and communications.
- Adapt: Glassdoor insights, ecommerce personalization, Sunbird DPI blocks, DigiLocker verification.
- Modify/Put to other uses: AI career coaches, compensation intelligence, talent marketplace.
- Eliminate/Reverse: manual parsing, siloed boards; proactive job suggestions and recruiter matching.

### What If Scenarios
- “Unlimited resources” → autonomous talent orchestration, fantasy-league team assembly.
- “Real-time learning” → adaptive scoring, per-recruiter memory, specialized AI agents.
- “Predictive hiring drives strategy” → business metric monitoring, proactive pipeline building, CXO-level advisory.
- Explored Agent ATS future where AI agents apply, get benchmarked, interviewed, and deployed with governance.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
- AI-assisted applicant forms with guided completion & validation.  
- Static-first profiles with optional living builder.  
- AI-first screening with transparent scoring and overrides.  
- Recruiter one-click workflows plus AI-suggested actions.  
- Multi-channel integrations (email, WhatsApp, Zoom/Meet) with AI summaries.  
- Credential verification via DigiLocker/public sources.  
- Flexible, pluggable data architecture (Apify, Sunbird, etc.).

### Future Innovations
- Multi-tenant job boards with bespoke UIs per employer.  
- AI recruiter co-pilot with organizational memory.  
- Glassdoor-style employer insights & compensation benchmarking.  
- AI career coaches and conversational profile completion.  
- Job seeker fingerprinting for team assembly intelligence.  
- Predictive hiring strategy engine and real-time learning loops.

### Moonshots
- Agent Application Tracking System (AATS) for hiring AI agents.  
- Autonomous talent operations orchestrated by AI.  
- Real-time adaptive learning pipelines for hiring outcomes.  
- Strategic talent intelligence that forecasts needs and builds pipelines automatically.  
- AI-to-AI interviews and compliance-guarded agent onboarding.

### Insights and Learnings
- Trust and transparency must be productized (visible justifications, audit logs, kill switches).  
- Data gravity enables compensation, trend, and preference intelligence—core differentiator.  
- India-first compliance (DigiLocker) plus global readiness future-proofs expansion.  
- Architecting for agent hiring now prevents rework when Phase 2 arrives.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Build functional ATS with workflows
- Rationale: Need a solid backbone covering applicant, recruiter, and hiring manager flows before layering advanced features.
- Next steps: Define end-to-end workflows, implement form builder + validation, wire recruiter actions, integrate baseline comms.
- Resources needed: Full-stack dev, workflow/state engine, auth, DB schema, comm integrations.
- Timeline: MVP sprint (current focus).

#### #2 Priority: Add AI features
- Rationale: Differentiates MOAR ATS and unlocks efficiency via AI co-pilots.
- Next steps: LLM-assisted JD/resume tooling, transparent scoring, AI-suggested recruiter prompts & questions.
- Resources needed: LLM APIs, prompt engineering, vector store, guardrails.
- Timeline: Immediately after core workflows stabilize (Phase 1.5).

#### #3 Priority: Deploy and test end-to-end on mselect.in
- Rationale: Validate real-world experience, ensure infrastructure and domain wiring work together.
- Next steps: Deploy to Vercel/Railway, connect domain, run full applicant→hire simulations, collect telemetry.
- Resources needed: CI/CD, hosting, domain/DNS, monitoring, sample data.
- Timeline: Post-AI enhancements (Phase 1.75).

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Grounding in value units and trust requirements.  
- Layered vision from MVP to Agent ATS without derailing near-term execution.  
- Mapping India-first infra and global expansion paths together.

### Areas for Further Exploration
- Detailed monetization levers and pricing experiments.  
- International compliance roadmap (post-India launch).  
- Benchmarking and governance framework for AI recruiter co-pilots and future agent hiring.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- Research workflow for competitor/market analysis.  
- Product Brief workflow to codify vision, differentiation, and metrics.  
- Later: Progressive Flow brainstorming focused on Agent ATS scenarios.

### Questions That Emerged
- How will we measure and surface trust/ transparency metrics?  
- What is the rollout plan for branded multi-tenant job boards?  
- How do we safely train and govern recruiter-specific AI memories?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:** AI governance, Agent ATS operating model, monetization experiments.  
- **Recommended timeframe:** After Product Brief & PRD completion (pre-architecture).  
- **Preparation needed:** Recruiter workflow samples, existing JD templates, data/infra inventory.
